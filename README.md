# Ethereum and Solidity - The Complete Developer's Guide
Final project for the Udemy course [Ethereum and Solidity - The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)  

A decentralized, Web3 version of a Kickstarter-like application that enables users to create new crowdfunding campaigns, donate funds to existing campaigns, and vote to authorize campaign managers' use of donated funds to support their projects. 

Built using Solidity (for the smart contracts deployed to Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet) and React (for the web frontend).
